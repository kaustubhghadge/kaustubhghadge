                <h3>What is the need for space research?</h3>
                <br>
                One of the most common arguments I’ve heard and keep hearing it again and again is that - Why should we spend money on sending satellites into space for research when there are a number of problems to be solved on the Earth? Especially for a country like India where we need to focus on economic growth and not spend money on unnecessary projects. This seems to be a fair question. Let’s look at the problem to be solved on Earth and one specifically important for all of the countries which need to grow economically - Electricity.  
                <br>
                <br>
                Let’s first define this problem to be solved in detail: 
                Do we have a consensus that electricity is a basic necessity in 21st century? With our increasing reliance on electronic devices for work, communication, travel etc. we can confidently say that electricity is one of the primal needs. Electricity generation and distribution are the two categories which have to be considered. Let’s focus on distribution for now, which we know has vast set of problems to be solved. We know that natural calamities like extreme heat, flooding, earthquakes, tornadoes etc can severely hamper the electricity distribution. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Apart from these there are some natural calamities triggered by Sun which can strike Earth and affect power generation and distribution, these include solar flares, coronal mass ejections(CMEs), high-speed solar wind, and solar energetic particles. Solar flares are an intense burst of radiation released from Sun. This radiated energy can disrupt the area of atmosphere in which radio waves travel. This can affect navigation and communication signals with recurring blackouts. While CMEs are large clouds of charged particles and magnetic field erupted from Sun’s surface carried over by solar winds. 
                <br>
                <br>
                When they hit Earth’s magnetic field these charged particles accelerate across earth’s magnetic field in the upper atmosphere where they collide with atmospheric particles creating auroras. The volume and spread of these charged particles colliding with atmospheric particles along with magnetic field carried over by solar winds result in oscillation of Earth’s magnetic field. These magnetic oscillations can generate electrical currents and overload the electrical systems.  If this happens without any advance warning, the overload of electrical current in grids can bring down them and leave millions without electricity. A similar catastrophe which took place in Quebec, Canada in 1989 can serve as a reminder for us that how vulnerable our current infrastructure is to the helm of space weather.

                </aside>
                Only by accurately understanding the Sun’s atmosphere and how solar winds impact and interact with Earth and its atmosphere, we can estimate a fairly accurate prediction of future vents and mitigate its effects on our world.
