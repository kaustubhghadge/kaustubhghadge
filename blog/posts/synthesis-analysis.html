                <h3>Synthesis vs Analysis</h3>
                <br>
                In the world focused on "analysis" we don't pay enough attention to synthesis. Synthetic thinking is the most undervalued skill that an analytical thinker should obtain. The symbiosis of analytical and synthetic thinking will enable us to perceive things better. 
                <br>
                <br>
                If we're solving a problem using the analytical tools we break down a problem into smaller pieces and solve it, we must then use synthetic thinking to formulate the problem again. This is incredibly hard but I think it will enable us to ask better and relevant questions. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I can think of one person who adopted this approach and consistently honed it - Leonardo Da Vinci. How does a man barred from attending the university or practicing any of the noble professions become a polymath?
                <br>
                <br>
                By using this approach, the cross-pollination of ideas enables interdisciplinary frameworks that augment our mental models.
